The Lämp is a battery-powered pocket demonstrator to convey fluorescence in diamonds.

For this purpose, a torch was retrofitted with a green LED light source mounted in a 3D-printed insert. A microdiamond is mounted on the LED. A constant current source inside the torch ensures that the LED is supplied with the appropriate current.

A colour filter is also mounted in front of the LED, which filters out the green light but allows the fluorescent light from the diamond to pass through so that it can be seen with the naked eye.
