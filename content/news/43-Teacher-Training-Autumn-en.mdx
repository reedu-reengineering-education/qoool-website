On 23 October at [experimenta Heilbronn](https://www.experimenta.science/) and during the week beginning 27 October at the [DPG site in Bad Honnef](https://www.dpg-physik.de/ueber-uns/physikzentrum-bad-honnef), several teacher training courses took place, focusing on the content and innovations of the QOOOL project, which were discussed with the participants. A total of three workshops offered teachers the opportunity to gain direct insight into the latest teaching materials and experimental setups for modern quantum physics developed in the project.

Participants were able to not only examine the newly developed materials for the QOOOL Fluoro kit, NV centres and colour phenomena, but also try them out for themselves, and even take some of the setups home with them to use in their own lessons.

The consistently positive response was particularly gratifying: teachers spontaneously bringing their colleagues to our stands, or workshops that had long since ended ‘on paper’ but were still full of energy on site, clearly show us how well our offerings are received and how great the interest is in low-threshold approaches to quantum physics.

This feedback reinforces our approach of developing cost-effective, practical and easy-to-implement experiments in quantum physics. We see the low price and minimal preparation required for teachers not only as an advantage, but as a genuine mark of quality in our work.

We are very happy with the success of the workshop week and look forward to the next opportunities to bring quantum technologies and modern quantum physics into schools!
