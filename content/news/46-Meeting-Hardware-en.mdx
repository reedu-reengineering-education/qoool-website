At today's work meeting, we brought together the senseBox, a specially developed prototype of the microwave generator, the QOOOL Power prototype and the π-Mk1 platform. Together, they form the future QOOOL Kit Magneto.

After everything had been creatively wired up, we were then able to detect ODMR signals.

We also discussed how the kit should be assembled in the future, how the individual modules should be arranged and mechanically fastened, what the cabling between the modules will look like, agreed on the power supply, and defined connector solutions.

All in all, it was a productive meeting with homework for each of us. Now it's time to implement the points discussed in a redesign of the modules so that QOOOL Kit Magneto can become a reality.
