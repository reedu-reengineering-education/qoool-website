# Quantum technology to try out at the Maker Faire 

We are delighted to be part of the 10th anniversary of [Maker Faire Deutschland](https://maker-faire.de/), the international trade fair for tinkerers, creatives and technology enthusiasts! From **17 to 18 August**, around 250 exhibitors will be presenting their projects and innovations in the fields of crafts, technology, education, art and science at the Hannover Congress Centrum, where they will be able to exchange ideas. The many hands-on activities and workshops will particularly inspire young people with an interest in technology.

Would you like to find out more about QOOOL sensing? Then visit us at the senseBox stand in the Niedersachsenhalle, stand number 12 üìç Here we will give you a first insight into quantum sensor technology using QOOOL kits for conveying fluorescence. The kits are designed as an extension of the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/en) and, in future expansion stages, will pave the way to a quantum magnetometer that will be used to teach fluorescence, quenching, ODMR and Zeeman splitting and thus the world of quantum technology and sensors. We are looking forward to your feedback! 

Here is a first taste of the senseBox microcontroller with a QOOOL kit::
