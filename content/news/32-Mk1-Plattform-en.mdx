Our π-Mk1 platform is the core element of the QOOOL Kit Magneto. In a space of only π cm³, it brings together all the critical components of an NV-based quantum sensor.

It cleverly houses a light source and its control system, a diamond, a colour filter and a photodetector, as well as signal pre-processing and a novel microwave resonator. In addition, the platform offers several options that may be of interest in the future.

The signals from the platform go directly and without detours to the senseBox, where they are captured and digitised by its analogue-to-digital converter (ADC). Incidentally, the platform is powered by our [QOOOL Power Module](https://qoool-sensing.org/en/news/31-Power-Modul-en).
