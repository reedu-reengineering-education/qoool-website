It was only two days ago that we presented ourselves at Quantum Effects 2025, and now we are back together again in the laboratory at the Institute for Intelligent Sensor Technology and Theoretical Electrical Engineering (IIS) in Stuttgart. This time on the agenda: sensitivity measurements on the QOOOL Kit Magneto with an HPHT diamond from Element Six. Numerous measurement series and analyses of the measured values later, we came to the conclusion that we achieve an unspectacular ~125 µT/sqrt(Hz).

Although we cannot measure brain waves or heartbeats with this result, everyone involved learned how to perform such a measurement professionally and got an idea of what experiments we can devise for the QOOOL Kit Magneto and for you to convey how the NV magnetometer actually works and what makes it so special. So it was a productive working meeting with new insights, clearer processes and new ideas for the next steps with the QOOOL Kit Magneto.
