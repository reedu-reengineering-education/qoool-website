With the final ‘QOOOL Kit Fluoro’, the QOOOL team presents the revised version of its compact demonstrator for displaying fluorescence phenomena (see [blog post](https://qoool-sensing.org/en/news/10-Fluoro-Kit-en)). The device is not a quantum sensor, but a central component in the project's educational concept: it paves the way for understanding the upcoming NV magnetometer ‘[QOOOL Kit Magneto](https://qoool-sensing.org/en/news/28-Hardwaremeeting-en)’.
 
The optimisation focused on practical improvements for educational and outreach use: a more robust, heat-resistant plastic housing, a clear separation between the fluorescent unit (transparent plastic frame with diamonds) and the optical filter (black plastic frame with different colour filters), and the ability to make the fluorescence visible without a microscope while also experimenting with different colour filters directly on the LEDs.
 
This is made possible, among other things, by the use of new, larger diamonds (700–850 µm) from Adámas Nanotechnologies in the USA and new colour filters. This combination improves the visibility of the fluorescence and makes the effect literally ‘tangible’.
 
The Fluoro demonstrator thus forms the ideal bridge between abstract theory and real-world experimentation – in school lessons, teacher training courses or at public science events. The circuit board from the previous model has been retained, with only the optical components and housing being modified: a resource-saving and sustainable further development.
