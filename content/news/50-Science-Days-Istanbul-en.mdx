From 12 to 16 January 2026, QOOOL Sensing was a guest at [İstanbul Erkek Lisesi](https://www.istanbullisesi.net/) – a school steeped in tradition that organised a varied programme under the motto ‘Experience Physics’ as part of its science week. We took on several items on the programme and provided around 300 places for schoolchildren. What we hadn't planned for was a severe winter storm that brought Istanbul to a standstill and led to a day off school. The result? Our entire programme had to be completed in just two days – a real quantum marathon!

**Newly developed teaching concepts were tested**

Despite the time constraints, Science Week offered us the perfect opportunity to test two newly developed lessons for the first time and directly in practice on multiple occasions. As expected, our workshop on biocuantum physics met with great interest. The second new development, a lesson on quantum technologies, was also completely booked out.

**From F centres to NV centres: quantum sensor technology in the classroom**

We are particularly proud of the concept behind our lesson on quantum technologies. The pupils were immersed in the fascinating world of quantum sensors. The didactic structure was initially based on curriculum-relevant content: using worksheets and amazing experiments, the participants explored the physics of F centres in salts. We then transferred these findings one-to-one to NV centres in diamonds – the basis of modern quantum magnetic field sensors. The lesson concluded with a look at socially relevant applications of quantum technologies in medicine and electrical engineering.

**Sustainable teaching materials for schools**

In addition to the workshops, we have significantly expanded the school's teaching resources: with a specially developed design for 3D-printed Michelson interferometers – four of them, in fact – the materials will remain available to the students in the future.

We would like to express our thanks to İstanbul Erkek Lisesi and the physics department for their excellent organisation and are delighted to have been able to contribute to Science Week!
