# Day 1: Start of the Qoool Camp ‘24 - Qoool Duel & Hands-on-Sessions

The [Quantum Effects Fair](https://www.messe-stuttgart.de/quantum-effects/ ) took place in Stuttgart from 8 to 9 October 2024. In addition to a stand at the [Qoool-Camp](https://aixpress.io/events/qoool-camp-24-qoool-duell-qooolcamp-thementische/), we (Hahn-Schickard, University of Stuttgart and re:edu) organised a Qoool duel with other cooperation partners (including [AIxpress](https://aixpress.io)) for students in grades 10 to 12. The playful, creative and application-based approach was designed to get the young target group in particular interested in quantum science. They were taught the basics of quantum (sensor) technology in a workshop organised by the [5th Physics Institute of the University of Stuttgart](https://www.pi5.uni-stuttgart.de/de/forschung/physik-und-ihre-didaktik/) and got to know the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/en/) in a hands-on session. Building on this, they developed their own business ideas and models.

# Launch of the Fluoro-Kit

We presented the [Fluoro kit](https://qoool-sensing.org/en/news/10-Fluoro-Kit-en) to enter the world of quantum for the first time at the fair. On the way to advanced technology, Fluoro is a precursor of a future kit with NV magnetometer for deeper insights into quantum physics.

# Qooolcamp theme tables

At the Qooolcamp theme tables on day 2, a total of seven theme tables on quantum technologies awaited you, for example: expert talks, practical reports, live demos, presentation of exhibits, serious games. In addition, on the second day of the trade fair, a large meeting of all projects in the ‘Quantum active - outreach concepts and open innovation for quantum technologies’ topic area took place parallel to the exhibition and presentation at the stand. These projects, funded by the BMBF as part of the research programme ‘Quantum systems. Developing cutting-edge technology. Shaping the future’ research programme enabled participants to exchange ideas in a compact and efficient manner. The QOOOL Sensing team was also represented with its partners re:edu and Hahn Schickard. These meetings are a valuable opportunity to identify important synergy points and strengthen the network between the projects for forward-looking collaboration in quantum technology.
