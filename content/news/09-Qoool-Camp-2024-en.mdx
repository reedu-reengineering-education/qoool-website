# Experience quantum technology up close: Qoool Camp ‘24 at the Quantum Effects trade fair in Stuttgart

On 8 and 9 October, Qoool Camp ‘24 will open its doors at the [Quantum Effects trade fair in Stuttgart](https://www.messe-stuttgart.de/quantum-effects/) and offer insights into the fascinating world of quantum sensors and quantum technology. Following the great success of the first two events, the Qoool Camp now presents exciting workshops and interactive events on quantum computing and quantum sensor technology on an area of 400 square metres.

Qoool Camp ‘24, organised by Softwarezentrum Böblingen/Sindelfingen e.V. and the AI xpress team, invites you to experience the future of technology up close. The event is co-organised by Wirtschaftsförderung Region Stuttgart GmbH and QOOOL Sensing. In addition to the launch of the QOOOL Kit Fluoro, the kit can be experienced first-hand in hands-on sessions on quantum sensing at the University of Stuttgart and the senseBox from re:edu!
