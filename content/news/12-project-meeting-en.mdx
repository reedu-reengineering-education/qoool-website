At the last meeting on 25 October with all project partners, there were again exciting developments and progress that we would like to share with you:

**1. improvements to the QOOOL Kit Fluoro: The next step**

Following the launch of the kit at the [Quantum Effects trade fair](https://qoool-sensing.org/en/news/11-Recap-Quantum-Effecs-en) in Stuttgart, we have been working on optimisations:

**New** LEDs and colour filters were researched and tested. These adjustments led to a pleasing result: the diamond is now much more visible - even without a microscope!

This makes the setup much more user-friendly and opens up new possibilities. We are therefore currently considering a QOOOL Kit **Fluoro 2.0**, which would incorporate these improvements.

At the same time, didactic content has been created for the QOOOL Kit so that it can be used as teaching content in schools and at extracurricular learning centres and can be learned in a fun way.

**2. ‘The Lämp ’**

The new LED has led to another demonstrator that we don't want to withhold from you. The Lämp is a modified torch that combines the tried and tested LED and colour filter with a diamond in a battery-powered pocket demonstrator.

**3. progress on the next QOOOL kit**

The next QOOOL Kit already has a name - QOOOL Kit Magneto. Although QOOOL Kit Fluoro is ideal for an introduction to the world of quanta, especially for understanding fluorescence in diamonds, work is already underway on another kit for advanced users, which will also make quenching, ODMR and Zeeman splitting tangible.A microwave resonator has been developed for this purpose, which is expected to impress with lower production costs and mechanical flexibility in the future. Two **Omega resonators** have already been successfully constructed and tested for this purpose.

In order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency, QOOOL Kit Magneto is also aiming to use LEDs instead of lasers. **Various LED light sources** and colour filters have already been tested, with two LEDs being particularly promising.

The meeting also served to collect ideas for the **QOOOL Kit Magneto**:
Various design aspects were discussed - QOOOL Kit Magneto as a **plug-on module for the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/en/)**, on which all the important components are integrated, or as a **modular pen**. We are still weighing up the pros and cons of the various approaches, including through experimentation.

**Next steps** include:

- Bringing QOOOL Kit Fluoro to the website as a virtual experiment.

- Weighing up whether a **QOOOL Kit Fluoro 2.0** should be launched.
- Development of designs for the new QOOOL Kit Magneto

- Construction and testing of initial circuits for light detection and testing of photodiodes

## Conclusion

The meeting showed how dynamic and innovative the QOOOL Sensing project is. With the optimised concepts and new technical approaches, the chances of presenting you with a QOOOL solution in the near future are good. We look forward to the next steps!
