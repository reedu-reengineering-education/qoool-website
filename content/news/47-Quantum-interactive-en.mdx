The QOOOL Sensing project is growing – and with it, our range of practical learning and experimentation materials on quantum technologies. New content is now available on our website, providing easy access to the world of quantum sensing while maintaining a solid foundation of knowledge.

Our new "Quantum Interactive" section offers a variety of digital learning resources that invite exploration and experimentation: from an interactive quiz on "Understanding NV Centers" to experiment instructions, such as for the QOOOL Kit Fluoro, and a worksheet on the quantum mechanical potential well. All materials are freely available and ready to use. Currently, the materials are only available in German!

We hope you enjoy discovering, experimenting, and exploring!
