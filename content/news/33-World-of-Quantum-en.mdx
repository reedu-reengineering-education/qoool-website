As part of this year's World of Quantum, the QOOOL Sensing project was part of the joint exhibition stand under the umbrella of the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) and the VDI, together with other projects from the Quantum Aktiv funding line. The so-called ‘Quantum Aktiv Corner’ was a highly frequented meeting point for interested visitors from science, education and industry throughout the entire exhibition.

We at QOOOL Sensing were also able to present key elements and current progress of our project in our exhibition area. The focus was on a large-scale demonstration setup – an optical table system designed by the Physics Education Department at the University of Stuttgart. This setup clearly illustrated the principles of an NV-based magnetometer and, with real magnetic field measurements, provided deep insight into how a ‘magnetic field microscope’ works. The setup was controlled by the senseBox MCU S2, in line with our approach of combining open hardware with state-of-the-art quantum technology.

Zusätzlich konnten wir erneut mit dem QOOOL Kit Fluoro für die senseBox eine kompakte Experimentierlösung zur Fluoreszenzdemonstration vorstellen - ein Bestandteil unserer didaktischen Strategie für Schulen und MINT-Lernorte.

A particular highlight was the first public presentation of a functional prototype of our upcoming NV magnetometer – QOOOL Kit Magneto. This compact sensor module forms the basis for the final version of our quantum kit and enables vector magnetometry in the smallest of spaces by exploiting a quantum effect – a step towards the widespread availability of quantum sensor technology in education and citizen science contexts.

The fair was characterised by intensive discussions with numerous visitors and a lively professional exchange with the other Quantum-Aktiv projects. In addition to the interest in our exhibits, the dialogue on common didactic and technical challenges was both valuable and inspiring.

We would like to thank the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) and the VDI for the opportunity to participate and for the excellent organisation. We would also like to express our sincere thanks to the Quantum Active Network for its strong community, and we look forward to the next steps together!
