# Enter the world of fluorescence and quantum physics with the new ‘Fluoro’ kit as an extension to the senseBox:edu S2!

Quantum physics becomes tangible with the QOOOL Sensing project. The ‘Fluoro’ kit makes it possible to immerse yourself in the phenomena of fluorescence and NV centres. Specially developed for pupils and students, the kit is equipped with controllable LEDs and colour filters to create various fluorescence effects. One highlight: the ruby red fluorescence of a diamond with NV centres under green LED light. The compact LED and diamond unit make the kit affordable and not only inspires technology enthusiasts. A microscope, connected to a tablet, PC or laptop, shows the effects in high resolution. The LED and micro-diamond unit are very small. With a microscope, the fluorescence effects produced can be observed and analysed directly on the tablet or PC screen in high resolution. This direct visual feedback makes the fluoro experiments particularly vivid. On the way to advanced technology, Fluoro is a precursor to a future kit with NV magnetometer for deeper insights into quantum physics. Fluoro is a good way to get to know and experience quantum physics.

We will be presenting the kit for the first time at the [Quantum Effects Trade Fair and Conference for Quantum Technologies](https://www.messe-stuttgart.de/quantum-effects/) from **8 to 9 October 2024** in Stuttgart - come along and try it out for yourself on site!

You can also learn more about quantum physics and the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/) in hands-on sessions as part of the [Qoool Camp](https://aixpress.io/projekte/qoool-camp-24/). Further information and the programme can be found at [www.qoool.io](https://aixpress.io/projekte/qoool-camp-24/).

We look forward to your visit!
