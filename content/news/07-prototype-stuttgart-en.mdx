## What do microwaves have to do with quanta? And what is a resonator? 

A microwave resonator is a device that can store microwave energy by reflecting and amplifying the waves in a confined space. They are designed to oscillate at a specific frequency, the resonant frequency. This leads to a significant amplification of the microwave energy at this frequency. The microwave resonator utilises the reflection of microwaves on its walls to generate standing waves. At the resonant frequency, the waves are amplified, resulting in higher energy absorption and storage. Microwave resonators are essential components in a wide range of technologies, from communications to quantum computing research. Their design and properties make them indispensable for the efficient storage and manipulation of microwave energy.

## What does this mean for QOOOL-Sensing?

The Institute for Intelligent Sensor Technology and Theoretical Electrical Engineering (IIS) at the University of Stuttgart, as our partner, are experts in intelligent sensor technology and integrated interface circuits. Yichao Peng is a research associate at the institute and designed, manufactured and tested the first prototype of a microwave (MW) resonator needed to control the nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV). He also tested the SPI interface as a synchronous serial communication interface, which is often used to connect microcontrollers to various peripheral devices such as sensors, SD cards, shift registers and displays to control the MW frequency. This makes the generator compatible with the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/en/) as an easy-to-program microcontroller for data collection. The first tests were promising, we will keep you updated!
