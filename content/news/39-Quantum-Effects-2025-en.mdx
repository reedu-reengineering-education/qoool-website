From 7 to 8 October 2025, it will be that time again: Quantum Effects (https://www.messe-stuttgart.de/quantum-effects/en/) in Stuttgart will open its doors, and our QOOOL Sensing team will be there once more! 

At stands 2E17 and 2F34, we invite visitors to experience quantum sensor technology for themselves in a playful way: together, we will make salts change colour, transform chestnuts into fluorescent secret writing, make plant veins visible and explore the colours of nature. With the QOOOL Kit Fluoro for the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/en/), we make â€˜diamondsâ€™ glow, while the QOOOL Kit Magneto makes neural firing visible. In doing so, we provide insights into the fascinating quantum physics behind it all and show how exciting quantum sensor technology can be in practical use. If you're looking for us, you'll easily recognise us by our qoool hoodies ðŸ˜‰ 

We look forward to seeing all curious visitors who want to stop by and experiment with us ðŸ˜Š
