Simon Koppenh√∂fer from the 5th PI of the University of Stuttgart has been a scientific friend of Mirpur in Azad Kashmir in Pakistan for several years due to a research stay in Germany. Friendships need to be cultivated, which is why Simon flew to the Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad and the University of Punjab at the Quaidi-Azam Campus in Lahore with a QOOOL Sensing lecture in his luggage. Both physics faculties welcomed him warmly and openly, as is very typical for Pakistan. The didactic lecture summarised the educational landscapes in Germany and Pakistan. In detail, we touched on the topics of teacher training, didactic research in physics and their national traditions and teaching materials. In the latter, the QOOOL Sensing project was cited as a positive example. One of the many similarities is that physics students in Germany and Pakistan are sometimes unable to relate physical theory to (experimental) reality. The question of the (German) solution to the problem is not easy to answer.Providing experiments as an answer certainly does not do complete justice to the matter.However, thanks to the hand experiment brought to the lecture, the 50 listeners now have a completely new understanding of the potential well model of quantum mechanics.In the favourable hand experiment, fluorescence was shown on chlorophyll in leaves.The indigenous chestnuts (Aesculin) from the mountain regions of the Himalayas can also be made to glow with UV light, which all participants particularly enjoyed.

We would like to thank our Pakistani friends for their extensive hospitality and scientific exchange and wish them all the best for the future!
