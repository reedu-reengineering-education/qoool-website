# Quantum technology to try out at the Maker Faire 

We are delighted to be part of the 10th anniversary of [Maker Faire Deutschland](https://maker-faire.de/), the international trade fair for tinkerers, creatives and technology enthusiasts! From **17 to 18 August**, around 250 exhibitors will be presenting their projects and innovations in the fields of crafts, technology, education, art and science at the Hannover Congress Centrum, where they will be able to exchange ideas. The many hands-on activities and workshops will particularly inspire young people with an interest in technology.

Would you like to find out more about QOOOL-Sensing? Then visit us at the exhibition stand of the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/en/) in the Niedersachsenhalle, stand number 12 üìç Here we will be presenting a first prototype of our QOOOL kit as an extension of the senseBox as a tool for collecting environmental data using quantum sensor technology and are looking forward to your feedback! 

Here is a first taste of the senseBox microcontroller with quantum sensor:
