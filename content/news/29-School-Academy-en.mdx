The German Student Academy - Youth Education in Society and Science, or DSA JGW for short, in Papenburg 2025-I begins on 21 July 2025, for which the final preparations have already been completed. The course is experimental in nature and is sure to fill a blind spot for some students.

The experimental focus means that numerous materials have to find their way from Stuttgart to Friesland. You can already guess which materials will fill the van from the pictures. The [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/en/), QOOOL Kit Fluoro and QOOOL Kit Magneto will also be there.

We have roughly divided the course into 5 stations. The main focus will be on setting up the NV magnetic field sensor, accompanied by several experiments relating to spin.

In addition, in our course on bioquantum physics, we implement a biological context and deal with spectrometry and other biological analysis methods. These will be accompanied by students in 8 quantum mechanical simulations.

We are also particularly pleased about the participation of friendly didactic research on photochromic molecular switches. This will round off the broad programme for the students.

We are looking forward to the intensive days ahead and wish everyone involved a great time. Check back here soon to gain a small insight into the Academy experiences.
