Now that we have succeeded in eliciting the first really good ODMR signals from a microdiamond, in the coming weeks and months we will be looking into the question of which diamond we will use in the planned QOOOL Kit Magneto.

We have various synthetically produced [diamonds](https://qoool-sensing.org/en/world-of-quantum#diamond) available for this purpose. 1. microdiamonds, with a size of ~150 Âµm, in the picture these are the diamonds in the vial, 2. large HPHT diamonds, which we kindly received from element6 (centre of picture), 3. a large, brown-looking HPHT diamond (bottom right of picture), which we received on loan from Fraunhofer IAO and 4. a CVD diamond (top right of picture). However, it is already clear today that it will not be the CVD diamond, it is simply too expensive for that.

1, 2 or 3 - stay tuned, we'll keep you up to date on which diamond we choose!
