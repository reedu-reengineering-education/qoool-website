# QOOOL Sensing at the didacta education fair: Experience quantum sensor technology in the International Year of the Quantum

Last week, the didacta trade fair for education took place in Stuttgart. We from QOOOL Sensing were there at the stand of our project partner [re:edu](https://reedu.de/) and showed interested trade fair visitors how they can use quantum sensor technology in STEM education. They were able to try out ‘The Lämp’ and the Fluoro Kit in combination with the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/en/) directly at the stand and gain their first insights into the world of quanta.

Especially in the International Year of the Quantum 2025, which emphasises the importance of quantum technology worldwide, it is particularly important to us to raise awareness of this fascinating science. After all, quantum physics is no longer just theory - it is increasingly finding its way into technologies that will shape our everyday lives. Through practical experiments and vivid demonstrations, we want to help teachers and students discover the potential of quantum sensor technology and utilise it in the classroom. The [senseBox:edu S2](https://sensebox.de/en/products-edus2) is a microcontroller specially designed for educational purposes. It serves as the basis for adding quantum sensor technology and provides an inexpensive, easy-to-assemble kit for teaching - especially in STEM subjects. This means that quantum technology can be used both in schools and at extracurricular learning centres and made accessible to a wider target group.

The enthusiasm at the stand showed us: Interest in quantum technologies is growing - and we look forward to further promoting this exciting area of STEM education!
