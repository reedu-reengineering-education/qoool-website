In the meantime, we have not only successfully tested our first ODMR setup with laser and microdiamond,...

...but also tested alternative light sources and different colour filters, which immediately led to significantly smaller setups for the QOOOL Kit Magneto, which also deliver ODMR signals and on which we were finally able to test the different diamonds. In the picture you can see our different setups with SMD LED and HPHT microdiamond (left), with SMD LED and large HPHT diamond (centre) and with wired LED and large HPHT diamond (right).

Below you can see the ODMR signal for the various light sources and diamonds without an external magnetic field applied.

It turns out that all diamonds deliver signals. But which diamond will be used in the QOOOL Kit Magneto?
We are still undecided about this. Presumably, the kit will be available in two different versions, one with the HPHT micro diamond from Adamas and one with the large HPHT diamonds from e6.

Incidentally, we have since returned the diamond that we were allowed to test on loan from the Fraunhofer IAO from the BMBF project [QOI](https://www.quantentechnologien.de/forschung/foerderung/quantum-aktiv-outreach-konzepte-und-open-innovation-fuer-quantentechnologien/qoi.html), but it behaved in a similar way to the e6 diamond.
