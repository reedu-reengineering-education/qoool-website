On 11 April 2025, the University of Münster opened its doors for an afternoon of citizen science. Under the motto ‘[think - participate - research](https://www.uni-muenster.de/de/veranstaltungskalender/prod/ausgabe/termine.php?layout=toptermin-detail&id=39233&einrichtungsid=46)’, the University Foundation Münster and the Research Transfer Office (AFO) invited visitors to take part in exciting DIY experiments, exchange ideas and hands-on science.

We from QOOOL Sensing were there with a hands-on station and were able to familiarise visitors with the world of quanta. Two special DIY exhibits attracted attention and aroused curiosity: the **Fluoro Kit** and **The Lämp**.

The **Fluoro Kit**, an extension of the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/) microcontroller platform for collecting environmental data, was used to show how the fluorescence of a synthetic diamond becomes visible with nitrogen defects and a colour filter, revealing quantum physical effects - an aha experience!

**The Lämp**, a battery-powered pocket demonstrator, also showed at a glance how this quantum effect works: A colour filter is mounted in front of an LED with a diamond, which filters out the green light but allows the fluorescent light from the diamond to pass through so that it is visible to the naked eye as a ruby red dot.

Numerous visitors took the opportunity to experiment for themselves and engage in dialogue with us. The overarching vision of the project was also particularly well received: to develop low-cost quantum sensor technology as an extension of the senseBox and implement it in the education sector in the long term.
