An important milestone in the QOOOL Sensing project was reached at a joint working meeting of the project partners on 14 July: under the motto ‘senseBox meets QOOOL Kit Magneto’, a prototype of the NV-based magnetometer was successfully controlled via the senseBox for the first time, and the first ODMR signals were visualised on the computer.

The commissioning went very smoothly - a strong indication of the development status of the hardware and the good preparation on all sides. This step brings us a step closer to our vision of a low-threshold, open NV quantum sensor for educational and citizen science applications.
