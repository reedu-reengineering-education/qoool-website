On 28 March 2025, another important working meeting of our QOOOL project took place - this time on the premises of the 5th Physics Institute in Stuttgart. In addition to intensive discussions and technical updates, there was one thing above all: an exciting outlook on an interactive learning environment for the QOOOL Kit!

## The web simulator - QOOOL becomes a virtual experience

To begin with, there was a brief introduction to Blockly for the senseBox as a graphical programming interface: block-based programming makes it easy to get started and the corresponding source code is provided alongside the blocks. The programming environment will initially be expanded to include the QOOOL kit Fluoro, so that I can display the senseBox as a microcontroller as a 2D model and observe and virtually try out various visual effects of fluorescence.

## Progress in our laser setup

Another item on the agenda was the presentation of our laser setup. Particularly pleasing: the signals generated with it have improved significantly compared to previous measurements. An important milestone that shows that we are on the right track - and at the same time motivates us to tackle the next steps with even more vigour.

## LED tests with diamonds

We also presented the LED set-up, which we used to test different LEDs and diamonds. The results are promising - if you want to delve deeper, you will soon find a separate article with all the details.

## Next goal: Microwave excitation of the diamond

We have also paved the way organisationally for the coming weeks: we have scheduled a separate working meeting on the microwave, at which we will focus even more intensively on this central component of our kit. An article with further insights will follow.

## Conclusion:

The working meeting in Stuttgart not only helped us technically, but also showed us once again how important the didactic link is. We are really looking forward to the further development of the web simulator - and of course to everything that is yet to come!
