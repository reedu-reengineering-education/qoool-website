It was a course that sparkled, sparkled and sometimes even danced: this year's Student Academy in Papenburg impressively demonstrated how seemingly contradictory disciplines such as biology and quantum physics can be combined to form a fascinating whole. The ‘Bioquantum Physics’ course, led by Anja Galm and Simon Koppenhöfer, brought together 16 highly motivated young people – with a delivery van full of experiments, two 3D printers and plenty of thirst for knowledge.

During the academy, the participants worked on the ‘salad disco’ and emulated nocturnal brain wave measurements. The participants simulated quantum mechanical processes, developed their own experiments and showed that they were not afraid of primary literature or circuit boards for LED irradiation.

One highlight was the experiment on the germination of lettuce seeds under different coloured light. Using specially constructed dark boxes, LED lighting and the right humidity, the participants investigated the influence of light wavelengths on the activation of the phytochrome receptor. The result: Lollo Rossa germinates differently from Lactuca Sativa – perhaps a question of molecular makeup?

But that's not all: the group also ventured into topics from QOOOL Sensing, such as the simulation of quantum mechanical colour formation in salts and molecules such as retinol. Some of the calculated absorption wavelengths were only ±30 nm away from the experimental value – an impressive achievement for students with no prior knowledge of quantum mechanics. In addition, neural bursts (= short phases in which nerve cells send out many electrical signals in rapid succession), NV centres in diamonds using the QOOOL Kit Magnetos, and the navigation of birds in the Earth's magnetic field were also discussed, demonstrating the enormous thematic range and scientific depth of the course.

Another highlight was the guest contribution by Dennis Lafeld (University of Jena), in which molecular photoswitches changed colour at the touch of a button. Related colour changes prompted participants to dance around a pot of chestnut bark broth to live flute music. How this came about remains a mystery to the Academy, because Academy experiences are special experiences.

What remains is more than just the experiments that were built or the final scientific documentation of the projects. What remains is proof that young people with openness, creativity and scientific curiosity are able to engage deeply with current issues in a very short time. The fact that social skills and genuine cooperation were developed in the process is perhaps the most lasting effect of this academy.

When quantum physics meets salad seeds, when laser mirrors target diamonds, and silent Arduinos come to life – then you know that ‘dry’ quantum mechanics can inspire.
