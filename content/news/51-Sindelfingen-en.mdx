We ended the first month of 2026 with a special highlight: on 30 January 2026, the QOOOL Sensing team visited the [Youth Research Centre (JFZ) in Sindelfingen](https://jung-forscher.de/) to teach students about the educational content of QOOOL Sensing. The JFZ offers workshops and learning sessions for school classes and pupils in an extracurricular setting to give pupils practical insights into technical/scientific topics.

As an associate partner in the QOOOL Sensing project, the JFZ organised school classes to offer the QOOOL Sensing team a platform for its workshop format as an outreach activity. To kick things off, the students at the Gottlieb Daimler School's vocational college and vocational school attended a lecture entitled "World of Sensors". We started with an introduction to sensors, where we can find them everywhere and on which physical measurement principles they are based. Quantum sensor technology was presented as another measurement principle. Afterwards, we worked in two groups in parallel. One group tested the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/en/) with the components supplied and was allowed to programme elements with [senseBox-Blockly](https://blockly.sensebox.de/).

The second group gained insight into the different physical measuring principles of sensors using sensor setups that had been brought along, on which the change in the measured variable could be tested in practice. This was followed by an introduction to quantum sensors with NV centres in diamonds. This content was explored in greater depth using the QOOOL Kit Fluoro and QOOOL Kit Magneto.

The QOOOL Sensing Team thoroughly enjoyed the workshop. The feedback from participants was overwhelmingly positive and confirmed that we were able to provide students with more knowledge about the senseBox platform, sensors in general, luminous diamonds and the associated quantum sensor technology.
