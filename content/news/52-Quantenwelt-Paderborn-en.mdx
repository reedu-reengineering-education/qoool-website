On 17 and 18 February 2026, we attended the event ‘Hands-on Quantum World – A New Experience of Education’ at the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum (HNF) in Paderborn.

The focus was on short, interactive sessions: projects from the ‘quantum aktiv’ and ‘Quantum Future Education’ funding programmes showed how quantum technologies can be taught in a practical and target group-oriented manner, with many examples to try out, discuss and take away. Everything was included, from didactic concepts to experiments, exhibits and learning materials.

For us, the event was above all an excellent opportunity for extensive networking. The direct exchange with project teams, education professionals and museum representatives, as well as the supporting programme of lectures and museum tours, resulted in many new contacts and concrete starting points for possible collaborations.

We are taking away many ideas and look forward to incorporating the discussions and ideas into our work at QOOOL Sensing.
