We are delighted that, as of yesterday, a QOOOL Kit Magneto demonstrator is now permanently in use at Fraunhofer IAO and thus by our colleagues from the [Quanderland](https://www.quantensysteme.info/projektatlas/projekte/q/quanderland) project.

The kit had previously been exposed to wind and weather at the [KONGRESS BW](https://www.kongress-bw.de/de) together with our colleagues in front of the congress hall, where it performed admirably. Now it can prove itself in other exciting areas of application. This will allow us to learn what the kit can and cannot do, as well as where we can make further improvements.
