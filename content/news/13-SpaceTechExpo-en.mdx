The QOOOL Sensing project also presented itself at the [Space Tech Expo](https://www.spacetechexpo-europe.com/) in Bremen from 19/11/2024 to 22/11/2024. With ‘The Lämp’, a modified torch in which the tried-and-tested LED and colour filter were combined with a diamond in a battery-powered pocket demonstrator, numerous trade fair visitors and exhibitors were inspired by the glowing diamond.

Perhaps a quantum sensor will fly into space or to the moon in the future? At least ‘The Lämp’ has already been on board the [SpaceBuzz One](https://www.dlr.de/de/ar/karriere-nachwuchs/spacebuzz-one) as a test.
