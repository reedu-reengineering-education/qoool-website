On the way to our QOOOL Kit Magneto, based on the π-Mk1 platform, we had already tested numerous components. One key component is the microwave excitation of the diamond. We have also developed a solution for this that requires extremely little microwave power and can be seamlessly integrated into our π-Mk1 platform.

We are pleased to announce that a publication entitled ‘A Highly Efficient, Low-Cost Microwave Resonator for Exciting a Diamond Sample from a Miniaturised Quantum Magnetometer’ has been published in an open access journal, i.e. accessible to everyone free of charge, describing this key component.

You can find the publication at the following link: [https://doi.org/10.3390/metrology5040069](https://doi.org/10.3390/metrology5040069)

Enjoy reading!
