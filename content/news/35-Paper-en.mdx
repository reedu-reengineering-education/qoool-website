On the way to our QOOOL Kit Magneto, based on the π-Mk1 platform, we tested many components and built and tested a first version of a miniaturised magnetometer as a predecessor to the π-Mk1 platform. We have documented our results and findings from the last few months on LEDs, diamonds, resonators and assemblies in a publication entitled ‘Components for an Inexpensive CW-ODMR NV-based Magnetometer’. We are pleased to announce that these results have now been published in an open access journal, i.e. accessible to everyone free of charge.

You can find the publication at the following link: [https://doi.org/10.3390/magnetism5030018](https://doi.org/10.3390/magnetism5030018)

Enjoy reading!
