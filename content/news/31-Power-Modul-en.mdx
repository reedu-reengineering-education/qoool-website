In order to operate our Ï€-Mk1 platform on the senseBox, a low-noise power supply is required. We deliberately decided against batteries or rechargeable batteries because they require infrastructure for replacement or recharging.

Instead, we have developed a USB power supply, the QOOOL Power Module. A first functional prototype has already delivered promising results, and a second one is currently being tested at the German Student Academy.

We used the time until his return to convert the QOOOL Power Module into a circuit board design that can be assembled and extensively tested shortly.

Together with the microwave generator board, it forms the QOOOL Kit Magneto for the senseBox, which already delivers amazingly good ODMR signals.
