On Saturday 24 May, the University of Stuttgart opened its doors to the general public. There were all kinds of stands with enchanting stations on various research topics, including the Department of Physics and its Didactics. In addition to bubbling cold vanilla ice cream and home-made electric motors, there were also three stations on the QOOOL Sensing project to marvel at. The first station was on the subject of fluorescence and was demonstrated using biological samples such as green leaves and chestnut bark. Here, visitors were able to leave secret messages and make the veins of rose petals glow. The second station was about salts that are coloured quantum mechanically instead of with dyes, in order to bring the topic of colour centres closer to the visitors. The last station focussed on the NV magnetometer setup. Here, visitors were able to put their own hands on the laboratory equipment and make the diamond glow. In addition to an NV quiz for the younger visitors, there was information about innovations at the school for older visitors, sometimes even combined with a bit of nostalgia. We would like to thank all the helpers and are already looking forward to the next Science Day in 2026.
