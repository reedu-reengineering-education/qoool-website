Two exciting days at Quantum Effects 2025 are now behind us: on 7 and 8 October, we once again welcomed numerous visitors to our stands in Stuttgart and immersed ourselves in the world of quantum sensor technology together.

After presenting our first prototype of the QOOOL Kit Fluoro last year (see [review](https://qoool-sensing.org/en/news/11-Recap-Quantum-Effecs-en)), we are now proud to present the final kit and, together with trade fair visitors, made ‘diamonds’ shine.

New addition: our prototype of the QOOOL Kit Magneto, which can also be used to visualise neural firing.

For the first time, we were able to try out our interactive NV magnetometer quiz – a playful format that allowed many students and interested parties to discover how quantum physics can be experienced in everyday life.

In addition to many other exciting experiments – from visible plant veins and colour-changing salts to fluorescent secret writing with chestnuts – participants also had the opportunity to learn about the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/) as a microcontroller for recording environmental data and [Blockly for senseBox](https://blockly.sensebox.de/) as a graphical programming interface, experiment with the QOOOL Kit Fluoro and try out quantum sensors for themselves. So there was something for all age groups and levels of experience to discover!

We were particularly delighted to welcome several school groups, whom we were able to introduce to quantum sensor technology with a compact and effective programme. This consisted of a short theoretical section, a practical workshop with the senseBox and concluding experiments with the QOOOL Kit Fluoro. The vivid experiments made the complex topic of quantum sensor technology tangible and exciting. In this context, we also revised and updated our learning materials to provide teachers and learners with even better support for entering the quantum world in the future.

Numerous industry representatives and experts also visited our stand, had the principle of the NV centre explained to them, marvelled at the Magneto prototype and provided valuable suggestions for further development – without us wanting to mention company names at this point.

We were delighted by the great interest, the many curious questions and the enthusiastic atmosphere on site, and would like to thank everyone who experimented with us!
