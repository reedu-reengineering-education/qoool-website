Last weekend, our QOOOL Sensing project was part of the big closing event [Quantum 100](https://www.quantum100.de/) in Münster, where it left many people amazed.

With our hands-on experiments, including colour formation in salts using Tesla coils, fluorescent chestnut branches, the cult object ‘The Lämp’ and the learning modules QOOOL Kit Fluoro and QOOOL Kit Magneto, we were able to impressively demonstrate how exciting, tangible and immediate quantum sensor technology can be experienced today.

A particular eye-catcher was the [senseBox](https://sensebox.de/en/) microcontroller, which we are expanding with initial quantum sensor components as part of the project. This transforms the well-known educational platform into a versatile tool that can not only collect environmental and weather data, but also enable quantum-sensitive measurements in the future – an important step towards bringing quantum technologies into schools and extracurricular learning environments.

Many visitors learned first-hand that quantum technology is no longer confined to isolated research laboratories. It is becoming visible, tangible and interactive in the truest sense of the word, enabling new forms of research-based learning.

In addition to the inspiring Quantum Active networking event, we were particularly pleased to exchange ideas with our colleagues from the QOI project, with whom we were able to provide a lively and intriguing insight into the world of quantum technologies.

An absolute highlight was the concert evening that rounded off the day: an exceptionally staged musical experience with an orchestra and a large school choir – inspired by physical phenomena and accompanied by impressive animations and light projections. The combination of music, science and artistic performance left a lasting impression – a real highlight of the weekend.

We would like to express our sincere thanks to everyone who stopped by – for their interest, the conversations, the amazement and the enthusiasm. Moments like these motivate us to continue bringing our QOOOL ideas to the world.
