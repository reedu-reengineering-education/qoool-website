Sitting under an apple tree and studying physics sounds like Isaac Newton and classical mechanics. At the JGW Academy in Papenburg, however, it clearly sounds like quantum physics, or more precisely, biocuantum physics.

The course, with 16 participants, 8 experimental setups, two 3D printers and 36 bright eyes, is as diverse as nature or the colours of the light spectrum. The course covers solid-state physics and electron spins as well as NV-centre-based magnetometers, medical imaging, biological colouring and biological analytics. With us, it's not just real brains that glow, crackle and sparkle, but artificial ones too.

Despite a glaring lack of sleep, the participants report back to us with motivation and interest, which makes us feel positive. The course leaders are no less sleep-deprived than the participants and are very satisfied with how the academy has gone so far.
