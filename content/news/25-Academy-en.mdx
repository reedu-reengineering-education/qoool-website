Preparations are currently underway for a 14-day summer academy for talented students in Germany. Admittedly, we are not grinding diamonds for this, but rather our course 3 on bioquantum physics, at the heart of which will be the NV Centre Magnetometer with its numerous bio- and medical applications. The academy starts on **21 July 2025** and, in addition to the diamond setups, also includes the other didactic experiments relating to the phenomena of fluorescence, spin and the Zeeman effect. This event is important for us as it allows us to gather detailed feedback on the didactic concept. For the pupils, the experimentally focussed course is the perfect complement to school lessons and it is important for making an informed decision, hopefully ;-) in favour of a STEM degree course. We wish all participants of this year's JGW Sch√ºlerakademie Papenburg 2025-1 a lot of anticipation and great insights into the world of science!
