On 24 and 25 September 2025, the Science Camp ‘[Quantum Peaks](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/de/veranstaltungen/2025/quantum-peaks.html)’ took place on the Zugspitze, organised by the BMFTR-funded project [Quanderland](https://www.quantensysteme.info/ projektatlas/projekte/q/quanderland) by colleagues from Fraunhofer IAO and the University of Stuttgart, with participants from science, industry and education. Impressed by the extraordinary mountain scenery and an excursion to the Schneeferner glacier, which is particularly affected by climate change, the participants worked together on the question of how quantum technologies can contribute to solving sustainability challenges.

The camp offered a varied programme. Following keynote speeches on topics such as sustainability, quantum sensors and quantum computing, the groups developed specific application scenarios in workshops. Challenges submitted by industry ranged from quantum sensor battery analysis and corrosion monitoring in electronics to reliable human detection in production. The role of quantum sensors, including NV-based approaches, was particularly evident and was taken up by several working groups.

Our QOOOL Sensing project was represented by [Reedu GmbH & Co. KG](https://reedu.de/). The interdisciplinary exchange was particularly valuable for us: on the one hand, we were able to learn about the diverse industrial applications, and on the other hand, we were able to contribute the educational aspect – in other words, the question of how the potential of quantum technologies can be communicated to pupils, teachers and students.

Our conclusion: Quantum Peaks was an inspiring change of perspective that showed how closely future topics such as sustainability and quantum technologies are linked. For QOOOL Sensing, this means tailwind, because it is precisely through such exchange formats that we can develop practical scenarios that flow into our didactic concepts and illustrate the relevance of quantum sensors for our target groups.
