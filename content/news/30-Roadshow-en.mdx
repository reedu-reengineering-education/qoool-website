QuantumBW, together with its partners Photonics BW, the Stuttgart Region Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and its network partners, invited participants to the Quantum Roadshow (https://www.quantumbw.de/de/news/auftakt-quanten-roadshow/). Over 100 participants learned about the potential of quantum technology. Hahn-Schickard presented our QOOOL Sensing project with the QOOOL Kit Magneto Demonstrator at the accompanying trade exhibition.
