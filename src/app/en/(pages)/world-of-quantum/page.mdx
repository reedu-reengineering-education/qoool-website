## Glossary

#### Energy Levels of NV
There is a triplet ground state (ground state ³A2), an excited triplet state (excited state, ³E), and a metastable singlet state (singlet state 1A1 and 1E).
In the ground state, there are three spin states of the electron pairs, ms=0 and the ms=±1 states. The ms=±1 is also described as a degenerate state because the ms=0 state is the more likely occurring state.
If an electron pair is in the ms=0 ground state and is excited by green light, it is raised to the excited ms=0 state. When returning to the ground state, it most likely follows a path where red light is emitted in the form of a photon plus lattice vibration (phonon). With lower probability, it takes the path through the singlet state, where only phonons are emitted, and lands in the ms=±1 state.
If an electron pair is in the ms=±1 ground state and is excited by green light, it is raised to the excited ms=±1 state. When returning to the ground state, it most likely takes the path through the singlet state, emitting invisible light as well as phonons, and lands in the ms=0 state. With lower probability, it directly falls into the ms=±1 ground state, emitting a red photon.

#### Ensemble
A collection of nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond, so close together that they interact with each other. They are simpler to manufacture and are cost-effective as microdiamonds.

#### Fluorescence
Light emission from the nitrogen-vacancy center in red through optical excitation with ultraviolet, blue, or green light. Here, stimulation raises an electron to a higher energy level, meaning it is promoted to a higher shell, and when it falls back to its original energy level, energy is emitted in the form of a photon.

#### Color Center
There are various color centers in crystal lattices; the most important for us is the NV center. This involves foreign atoms trapped in a crystal lattice, which cause absorption of specific wavelengths of light, resulting in a specific color of the crystal.

#### NV Center
Short for Nitrogen Vacancy. The crystal lattice of a diamond consists of carbon. Nitrogen is embedded in this lattice, leaving a vacancy. An additional electron from the crystal lattice can become trapped at this nitrogen-vacancy center, creating an NV- center. This can be used as a quantum system at room temperature. It absorbs green light and shorter wavelengths, like blue and ultraviolet light.

#### ODMR
Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) is a measurement technique used to optically read the energy levels of the spin states of an electron pair. The energy levels of the ms=±1 spin states of an electron pair change due to the presence of a magnetic field, electric field, temperature, or pressure, known as Zeeman splitting.
For ODMR, optical excitation with green light and a microwave is required. Microwave excitation can increase the likelihood that electron pairs are in the ms=±1 state, while optical excitation with green light increases the likelihood that electron pairs are in the ms=0 state, allowing the system to be initialized. Initialization here means that the initial state is known with high probability.
Microwave frequency is then varied, and the corresponding fluorescence intensity is measured. This experiment is repeated multiple times, and the results are averaged. This way, a fluorescence spectrum with dips (decreases in intensity) corresponding to the energies of the ms=±1 states is obtained. The distance between the dips correlates with the strength of a magnetic field, and their absolute position, relative to the zero-phonon line (ZPL), corresponds to a temperature.

#### Quenching
Measurement of fluorescence intensity that depends on the magnetic field strength through optical excitation with green light and optical readout.

#### Single NV
A single nitrogen-vacancy center in a diamond, or multiple centers with a sufficiently large distance between them, so they do not interact with each other.

#### Zeeman Splitting
The splitting of the fluorescence dip in the fluorescence spectrum due to the presence of a magnetic field. At frequencies below 2.87 GHz, the ms=-1 dip can be observed, and at frequencies above 2.87 GHz, the ms=+1 dip can be observed. In the energy-level diagram, the energy levels move further apart as a magnetic field is applied.

#### ZFS
Zero Field Splitting (2.87 GHz) is the energy difference between ms=0 and ms=±1 at a temperature of around 27°C and no external magnetic field. The frequency of ZFS changes with temperature, making it useful for temperature measurement.
