### Institut für Mikroaufbautechnik

The Institute of Micro Packaging Technology at the Hahn-Schickard-Gesellschaft für angewandte Forschung e.V. in Stuttgart has been working in the field of microintegration of complex, three-dimensional systems with a high degree of miniaturisation for more than 20 years. Its core competences lie in technologies for spatial circuit carriers and microstructures as well as in assembly and connection technology, which is used in particular for the seamless integration of sensors in demanding environmental conditions. Hahn-Schickard is working on fundamental issues relating to the encapsulation of miniaturised quantum sensor assemblies and the simulation-based thermal management of NV-based magnetic field sensors in two research projects as part of the BMBF's QSens future cluster. In the QOOOL Sensing project, Hahn-Schickard will develop and build the quantum sensor module at the heart of the QOOOL kit, thus contributing its expertise in the field of sensor technology.

### Institut für Intelligente Sensorik und Theoretische Elektrotechnik

The Institute for Intelligent Sensors and Theoretical Electrical Engineering (IIS) is involved in the research and practical implementation of new sensor concepts. In addition to improving classical sensors, the IIS focuses on researching new, miniaturised excitation and readout concepts for various quantum sensors. After many years of experience in the miniaturisation of classical nuclear and electron spin resonance, the institute has been working for several years on CMOS-integrated microwave excitation concepts (CMOS = Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor as a technology for the construction of electronic circuits in integrated circuits) as well as (CMOS-integrated) ultra-low noise current readout circuits for solid-state quantum sensors such as NV centres and silicon sensors. e.g. NV centres and silicon defects in SiC (= silicon carbide, a chemical compound of silicon and carbon). In the area of education and training, the IIS is responsible for training in the subjects of electrodynamics and sensor and measurement technology in the electrical engineering degree programmes. The IIS also supervises the "Build your own MRI" practical course, in which students design their own MRI device.

### 5th Institute of Physics of the University of Stuttgart

The "Physics Didactics Research" department at the 5th Institute of Physics at the University of Stuttgart represents a link between the subject science and the school. Current research focuses on the development of new teaching concepts for modern physics, the accompanying transition from school to university in the context of teacher training programmes, the development, construction and testing of new demonstration experiments for teacher training purposes as well as for direct use in schools and student laboratories, and the preparation of digital offerings for teachers. In teaching, the focus is on the didactic training of prospective physics teachers with a particular focus on physics experiments. The QOOOL project fits perfectly into this context. The department can contribute its experience in setting up modern experiments and didactic concepts for school and university use and subject them to initial practical tests and further development in the "Game of Forces" school laboratory.

### QSens

QSens is dedicated to the development of quantum sensors, a novel technology in the field of metrology and sensor technology that has a sensitivity on the edge of what is theoretically possible. This new type of sensor can be used, for example, in medical technology, autonomous navigation and renewable energies. Quantum sensor technology is still in its infancy. Promising prototypes have been tested in the first successful feasibility studies, and this is precisely where QSens comes in: Based on the results of basic research, the Future Cluster finalist is working on the field in an interdisciplinary manner with partners from the natural sciences, engineering and industry.

### QOI

The Quantum Open Innovation (QOI) project aims to develop a low-cost open hardware construction kit for the target groups of schoolchildren, citizens, makers, designers, students, researchers and professionals. The second step is to use the construction kit to build an open innovation community in order to transfer the results of quantum research into broad application in the third step. In order to cater to the breadth of target groups, a modular, expandable construction kit is needed that is also cost-effective so that quantum innovations and application ideas can be prototyped.
